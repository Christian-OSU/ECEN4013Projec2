Extra stuff: I have 5" quadcopters with FC/ESC/RX/etc.

 Using the setup described, would I be able to use a CRSF receiver and telemetry to pass data to a transmitter?

Short answer: Yes — absolutely possible, as long as you wire the Teensy to the receiver’s CRSF/telemetry UART and either (A) make the Teensy speak the CRSF telemetry protocol or (B) put a flight controller / firmware in between that already implements CRSF telemetry.

Below is a practical checklist + gotchas and a small roadmap you can follow immediately.

What you need (hardware)

A CRSF-capable receiver with an exposed CRSF telemetry/UART pad (many TBS Crossfire and newer receivers expose a dedicated pad).

Teensy 4.1 (3.3 V I/O) — good: voltage levels match typical CRSF TTL.

Common ground between Teensy and receiver.

UART TX/RX lines between Teensy and the receiver’s CRSF pad (use the RX/TX labeled for CRSF or the “SmartPort/Telemetry” pad if the receiver docs say it supports CRSF on that pad).

Wiring rules / hardware notes

Teensy I/O = 3.3 V → compatible with most CRSF receivers (do not use 5 V signals).

Use the receiver’s CRSF UART pad — do not connect to an SBUS (inverted) pad by mistake. CRSF is not SBUS-inverted.

Cross-check the receiver’s documentation to find which pad/connector is the CRSF/telemetry port (some receivers have a dedicated port or a pad labeled CRSF/TEL).

Software options

Have the Teensy send CRSF telemetry frames directly

Implement CRSF telemetry framing on the Teensy and send the telemetry packets over UART. The transmitter will receive telemetry and display fields it recognizes.

This is the most direct approach if you want the Teensy to publish GPS/IMU values itself.

Use an intermediate flight controller or firmware

If you already run Betaflight/INAV/ArduPilot on an FC, let the FC collect telemetry from the Teensy (e.g., via UART or MSP) and let the FC forward telemetry to the receiver (FC implements CRSF). Simpler because FC firmware already knows CRSF and maps telemetry fields.

Use an existing CRSF library

There are open-source libraries and examples (C/C++) that implement CRSF framing and telemetry. Reusing one saves a lot of time vs writing the protocol from scratch.

Practical limitations & mapping

Bandwidth is limited. CRSF telemetry is compact and optimized for RC telemetry — don't expect high-rate streaming like raw IMU at kHz. Pack values tightly and only send what you need (GPS coords, heading, battery, a few sensor values).

Transmitter display mapping. The TX will only display telemetry fields it knows or that you map to custom telemetry fields. Some TXs allow custom telemetry screens; others only show standard fields. If you want custom fields, check your TX firmware’s capabilities (OpenTX/EdgeTX support custom telemetry items better than stock TX software).

Units & scaling. Telemetry packets use integer payloads/scaled values. Convert floats to scaled integers (e.g., latitude/longitude in 1e-7 degrees or GPS as expected by the telemetry schema).

Steps to get started (minimal)

Identify the receiver pad for CRSF telemetry and wire RX/TX + GND to Teensy (Teensy TX → Receiver RX, Teensy RX → Receiver TX).

Confirm voltage levels (Teensy 3.3 V OK).

Decide: Teensy implements CRSF frames OR feed data to FC.

Either:

Find a CRSF telemetry library and adapt it to Teensy; or

Use FC firmware to receive your telemetry and let the FC forward CRSF.

Test by sending a small telemetry packet (e.g., a single value) and watch the TX telemetry display.

Gotchas to watch

Wrong pad (SBUS vs CRSF) or inverted serial causes no comms or damage risk.

Some receivers require enabling telemetry in their menu or binding profile.

Telemetry naming and units must match transmitter expectations to be shown nicely.

If you want, I can:

draw a simple wiring snippet using your Teensy + the specific receiver you listed earlier, and

sketch a minimal Teensy pseudo-code outline that sends a compact telemetry packet (or point you to a CRSF telemetry C example you can drop into Teensy).

Which would you prefer — a wiring + pin mapping diagram for your exact receiver, or a Teensy pseudo-code example of sending telemetry frames?

Can wire Teensy up to FC to transmit data through CRSF protocol (900MHz, long range)
